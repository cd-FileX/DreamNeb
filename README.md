# This project will or already has moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/FileX/DreamNeb) as GitHub would else use this Open-Source and Non-Commercial Project for their own money-making purposes: Their [Coding AI](https://github.com/features/copilot/)

"It (Copilot) has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub."

I am aware that this does not mean it is unable to find me on Codeberg but the chances are lower than they are on GitHub. <br>Codeberg also has other advantages like being totally free and open-source as well as being an e.V. (Non-Commercial company) and residing in Germany.
